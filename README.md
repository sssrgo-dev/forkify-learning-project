Frontend project, using MVC and async Java Script

It was my first JS learning course. I've done it step by step with the dictor. The completion of the project laid down my path to deep JS learning through FrontendMasters school and MDN JS documentation description site to strict findings answers to my questions about language in ECMAScript specification. I leave it as it is, that you can see how huge my progress in next repositories, in comparison to this one.
